# PIDWithMachineLearning
This is the result of almost 2 months of work for my intelligent control systems class, where we built some container filling and mixing simulations and then I tried to apply machine learning algorithms (gradient descent and genetic algorithm) to find the best parameters for the PID controller. Works, sort of.
